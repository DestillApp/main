In v0.0.1 application is contenerized, services are communicating with API and API with DB.

However this does not mean application work as intended. On frontend, only first page is displayed
(poorly) and login button does nothing due to "Firefox canâ€™t establish a connection to the server at ws://172.20.0.2:8080/ws."
As for the backend "Cannot perform GET /" or something like that.
This is the case when accessed from the outside of the network, within Tailnet.

For the next version the plan is to implement Nginx reverse proxy to allow non problematic communication between services. 

Adding another container creates a need for container management tool. Kubernetes is considered to be implemented in the next releases.
