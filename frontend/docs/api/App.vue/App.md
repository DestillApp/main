# App

Welcome to the Vue API documentation for the DestillationApp frontend!

The `App` component is the root of the application. It sets up the main layout, including the header and the router view for all pages. It also manages the global theme (light/dark) and initializes user settings from local storage.

## Features

- Provides the main application layout.
- Handles theme switching (light/dark) based on user settings.
- Loads user preferences on startup.
- Integrates the main navigation header and page routing.

## Usage

The `App` component is automatically used as the root component in the application. You do not need to import or use it directly.

## Source

See [`src/App.vue`](../../../src/App.vue) for the implementation.
